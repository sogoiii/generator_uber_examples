Intro:
------

This is a set of examples of using generators around an existing api. There is a raw example if you wish to view. The purpose is to show how to wrap your api and use generator manager like co.


Example Description:
------

Our [uber api](https://developer.uber.com/v1/endpoints) gets the products, time, and price for a location. Returning a large object with data from each endpoint.


```javascript
var getInfo = {
      products: {},
      time: {},
      price: {}
    }
```


Getting Started:
------
1. Install node 0.11 or greater
2. git clone this repo
3. npm install
4. [Create](https://developer.uber.com/getting-started/) your own api keys, and modify the config.js file with your keys
5. Review the Command List to run 


Details:
------
I set up config.js to be easily modified to add new locations. If you want to see the price between Disney Land and LAX, make the following change in the file you are running.

```javascript
var queryObj = {
  start_latitude: locations.disneyLand.latitude,
  start_longitude: locations.disneyLand.longitude,
  end_latitude: locations.LAX.latitude,
  end_longitude: locations.LAX.longitude
}
```

If you want to test our your location, try something like [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/) and create another object with your desired name, latitude, and longitude variables.

------
